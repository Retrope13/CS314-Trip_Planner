## Planned Epics

For sprint #1 we plan on completing 2 different epics one called "team identification" and the other is called "about".

For our team identification epic we will complete 3 seperate tasks. our first task is to set the team number as well as the team name on to our server. Then we will set the team number as well as the team name on to the client. Finally we will set the team name in the browser tab.

For the about epic our team will tackle 5 seperate tasks. We will first attempt to update the design for the addition of team and member information. We will started creating/adding new components to support the structure. Our third task will be to write a team mission statement. Next we will have to create a team image. Then finally our team will add images, our names, and a short bio about ourselves.

## Retrospective

#### Things that went well

Team communication at this point has gone great, we seem to all be helping each other through rough points and we all make sure everyone is up to date and aware of issues that need to be done. We have all learned new skills from one another

#### Things that we need to improve

Some things are team could improve apon is communication through our slack channel. Time management was a big factor in this sprint for all of us in the future, we are going to try to start on our epics and tasks earlier on. In this way we have a better chance to get alot more tasks and epics completed by the end of the sprint.

#### One thing we will change next time

One thing we will try to do next sprint is to set up an in person meeting point on campus where we can all meet and talk about our assignment and what each member will need to do by the next meeting.
