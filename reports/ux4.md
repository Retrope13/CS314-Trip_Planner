# User Experience - Team *T21* 

The report summarizes user experience testing performed on the team's application.

Each developer should ask the user to accomplish one or more simple tasks while monitoring their efforts.  
The user should attempt to complete the tasks without any aid from the developer.
Use a pseudonym to identify the user below. 
Set a time limit and tasks for the user to perform.

 
### Tasks

Each user should complete the following tasks in 10 minutes.
Developers should not guide the user, but the user may ask for help as a last resort.  
Consider this a failure when it happens.  

1. Change the trip name
2. Add a location through the searchbar
3. Add three random locations
4. Get the user's current location
5. Change the distance units
6. Add a location through the latitude/longitude search
7. Save the trip file to the computer
8. Trash all of the locations in itinerary
9. Load the previously saved file

| Task | problem, aid, observation | hi/med/low | github#  |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | 
| Hover Messages | Guessing for each button usage, clicked through buttons trying to find the right one, could have been avoided with hover messages| med | #382 | 
| Save Name and Confirm Save | Tester wanted to save to certain folder with custom name file, could be fixed by giving similar popup as the load function but for saving  | low | #383 | 
| Highlight Selected Place in List | Tester was confused on which place in list was selected on map, because our places now only list the first few words the list was basically entirely "Colorado State University" and user didn't know which place was currently highlighted | low | #384 | 
| Delete User Units | Tester created various units that were all saved, cluttered their list of units | low | #385 |
| Add location through the latitude/longitude search | User though that the main search bar could take lat/long input | med | #387 |
| Change the distance units | User clicked on several buttons since the icon didn't seem related | low | #388 |
