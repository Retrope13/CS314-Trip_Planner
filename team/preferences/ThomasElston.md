1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Im easier to reach out to via text message or snap, my personal number if anyone needs to contact me is 720-552-2105 and my snap is beefman1010101 if I’m not in class I can usually respond anytime. Im not usually a morning person so if you try to reach out to me before 10am i may not respond for a while. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * This semester I hope my teammates and I are able to put our differences aside and find a way to work together. As any project won't be able to be completed without figuring out the team aspect first.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I would love to see great improvement from myself, I’m generally good at working by myself, but I do see great opportunity here to improve myself and my communication skills before heading out into the real world where communication is incredibly important. By the time this class is finished id like to be comfortable with myself enough to be able to smoothly transition what I learned into the work place.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   *  Most likely the biggest obstacle would be time management and or communication between team members.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If it comes down to it a group member who wants an A might have to work a little harder in order to achieve that A status by helping the B person out. Or we would need a team meeting about our standards and how we can achieve the best possible work out of our group.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I believe the hardest working students do deserve a higher grade how ever I would hope we can divide the work evenly enough to be able to not have this happen.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Im assuming if all team members were able to work together properly I would think 8 hours or so a week would do the trick.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Hopefully we will divide tasks among everyone based on those persons strengths.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The first time we should let it slide however if a pattern starts accuring we should either get a team meeting going on to discus it or we should go the other route and notify dave.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * If the conflict were to arise we would need to re-evaluate our standards for the projects future.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I would try to be accepting of it however if it really bothered me I would most likely confront them about it and politely ask them if they could stop that habit.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I would like to have a standard meeting time, I feel like this would help be added pressure for the team to come together and work on the project.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I would like to see us work outside of class around 2 times a week.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I believe a majority rule might work a little better, just in case 1 or 2 of us aren’t able to make a meeting or are not 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * My majority rule idea would take care of this, but if that doesn't end up happening the group would most likely need a discussion about it to resolve it. That may involve changing the plan up slightly.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Speak up, and see if theirs a more even way to do things.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I'd ask the group if someone could take some of the responsibility off of me.
