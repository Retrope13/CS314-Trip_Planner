1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * answer: I would suggest texting or e-mail since I respond within two to three hours to emails. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * answer: The expectation I have is that we will be able to complete the task entrusted to us by working together to avoid feeling alone or forgotten.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * answer:I'm trying to be more outgoing, learn how to work in a team, and help if someone in the team is struggling.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * answer: Occasionally, my tone might sound rude, however, I am working on improving it. I have little experience with coding compared to others on my team, which might
             prolong the task completion time (Lack of Coding Experience).
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * answer: Everyone should strive for the highest grade so that at the end of the semester they can say they did their best. I myself don't place too much emphasis on grades
    but give as much attention as needed to the task at hand. As a result of this approach, I am able to relax while working and feel confident that I have given it my all.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * answer: Team members cannot be burdened with different tasks and achieve an "A" in the course. Burdening one individual and getting a "A" in course may cause the
    person to give up on their teammates, which is detrimental in the long term.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * answer: It is far more than sufficient to work just 28-35 hours a week or even less, as long as one is focused and not distracted. If one can balance the work and
    the time, then one can enjoy both.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * answer: By learning everyone's strengths and weaknesses and assigning them tasks in which they are weak, they can improve their skills. They can be helped when
    they are stuck. This would be my approach.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * answer:  Everyone should be aware of the consequences if they do not follow through with their commitment. It will be up to the team to decide what punishment
    to give the individual unless there are valid reasons for it.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * answer: A discussion must be held on what the quality of work should be, keeping in mind the experience and knowledge of individuals within the team. The
    quality can be improved by adding patch-ups later on and therefore our main task should be a proper working code.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * answer:  As long as the task is complete and team members are not disturbed I have no issues. Everyone has a different way of completing tasks, however
    as long as everyone is consistent, I don't see the need to force anyone to change their habits. But if the work requires something extra I might force
    everyone to be on the same working habit.  
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * answer: Every once or twice a week outside of class, a meeting should be held so that everyone can know how they are doing.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * answer: Once or twice is more than enough, but it can be increased if the task becomes difficult.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * answer: Yes, getting everyone on the same page makes everyone feel more inclusive, and any new ideas can be discussed and implemented.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * answer: There needs to be a discussion and understanding of the reasoning behind the disapproval and solving the issue. For a team to grow,
    it is important to make sure everyone agrees.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * answer: The task given to the person should be distributed, and everyone should advise the person on how to cooperate and learn from one another rather than dominate.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * answer: Discuss this issue with the team members first and find a solution and then, if nothing works, seek guidance from the supervisor/class teacher on how to proceed.
