# Preferences for _Sam McKay_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text or Snapchat is probably the best way to reach me. I'm usually up by 10am and go to sleep around 12pm.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I really want us to be able to work together in a respectful way and ask for help if we need it or offer it if we think we could help.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to be able to work on my ability to trust others to complete their work and my ability to ask for help.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Time conflicts are the most likely obstacle in my opinion, but communication would be able to fix this easily.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * If there are team members that want to get an A they should reflect that in the quality and quantity of work they do. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Since everyone has their own schedules and commitments I think it's perfectly fine if some want to work more to get an A as long as it doesn't prevent others from getting the grade they want.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Currently I'm not sure, but judging by cs253 I'd say about 15 or so hours a week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * There should be a consideration about what we are the best at and how we quickly we can achieve a desired result, but if someone finds an aspect of a project interesting and wants to get better at it then we should allow them the opportunity to improve.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I think the first two times it happens I will be very understanding, but if it happens repeatedly I will confront them.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I think the best solution to this problem would be to meet up on discord or in person if we can and average what each individual thinks of the quality and work from there.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * If some of the team members have a hard time being responsible for their own work we can always meet up and try to motivate each other and keep each other accountable.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Since we all have different aspects of our lives going on we could plan for a standard meeting time, but if conflicts arise be prepared to reschedule. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I'm not sure that we will need to, but meeting outside of class will most likely have a positive impact on the quality of work that we do. I assume a few hours a week would be nice to verify we're still on track and don't have any questions.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * No. There are some decisions that should include everyone such as aesthetic choices, but I have faith that my teammates can make their own decisions
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Acknowledge their opinion and perspective, but respectfully decline it.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * It depends on if their leadership is hindering or helping the team. If it's damaging the interaction of the team ask them to not work themselves too hard and focus on their work.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Talk to my teammates about redistributing the workload for my sake.
