# Preferences for Ernest Duckworth

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * answer: I would prefer to be texted, I tend to respond to texts faster than emails. If it is urgent I would also reccomend calling becasue I am a very active person who forgets about their phone pretty easily. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * answer: The expectations that I have for our group are just to really work together as a team and focus on improving as a whole. I want us all to learn how to properly work in a group setting. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * answer: My personal goals would include helping my teammates more often, because I never had to code in a group setting I have always been bad about helping my classmates when they are struggling (which sounds really selfish), I also want to work on my patience with people
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I think that I am going to run into the problem of overworking, and trying to do too much while in this group, I really love to learn and code as much as possible and I wouldn't want to come off as a control freak so Im going to have to learn to trust my teammates and only try and help them when they ask for it. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I think that we would have to have a conversation within the group, no matter what I beleive that everyone should be striving for the highest grade
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * answer: No I do not beleive that should be required, becasue then we are also enforcing the idea that to get decent grade 'B' you dont have to do as much work as others in your group who want the A
   * 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * answer: That depends on the project and what is going to be done but I don't beleive it should be over 10 hours. 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * answer: This should be done by the group as a whole after talking about everyones skillsets everyone should help decide who works on what. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * answer: That I beleive should be up to the team to decide, depending on how important the work was or how drastic the reason they didnt finishh it was.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * answer: thats a difficult question because we all might be at very differnt places in our coding expierence, I would find it unfair to hold someone with little expierence to such a high standard
   * I think it would be most fair for the group to decide and possibly even have days where we review and fix each others code. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * answer: I wouldn't really deal with it unless it was causing problems for the group, and in that case I would think discussing it as a group would have the best outcome
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * answer: I think that at least 1 meeting outside of class is needed just so that everyone can be clear on what they are suppose to be doing. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * answer: I think that once or twice would be perfect, and there is even the possiblity of meeting online if some people can't attend. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * answer: yes I think that everyone in the group should be apart of making decisions. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * answer: Thats a tough question, I think the best thing to do is try and come up with a comprimise and if that cant be reached try and settle it some other way with the person who is disagreeing. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * answer: If someone is dominating the team process we should all speak to them and try and split up their work
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * answer: I would express my feelings to the group and split my responsibilities up with the group, but if nothing changes after that then I would consider talking to supervisors/TA/teacher about how this problem can be fixed
