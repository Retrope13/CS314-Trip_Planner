# Preferences for _Max Scalf_

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text message would be the best way to reach me if something was urgent at any hour, but I check email/Discord/Slack regularly throughout the day. I am generally awake ~7 AM - ~10PM, but that is definitely not a rigid schedule. I have a few hours free around 11-1 each week day, and am typically available after 2 PM M/W/F and after 5 PM T/TH
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect us to do as much as we are asked to do, and not bite off more than we can chew trying to go too far above and beyond.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I want to get to the point where I can really work as a team, rather than just five individuals each doing their own thing.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Not being able to communicate effectively and trying to get used to using new tools/programming languages/etc.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I am not too worried about how we will be graded as long as we get done as much as we are able to
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * To a certain degree, sure this is fine as long as it does not interfere with the work of any other teammates
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * I really have no idea at the moment, ~12 hours maybe? I am sure it will become clear in the following weeks and adjustments will be made
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Taking count of who is best/most experienced in certain areas, letting people choose what they are most comfortable with (although not everyone will always get something they are comfortable with)
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * I will be understanding if something came up that made them unable to get it done, but firm on what they are expected to do. But things are always flexible, so they need to communicate if they need some help.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * If we have sufficient time, we can strive to make the work better, but if we are near the end of a sprint then we will have to focus on the future and doing better next time
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Different work habits are fine as long as it does not interfere with other teammates, everyone has their own way of getting things done
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I don't have anything like that in mind, but we can make those plans if the rest of the team wishes
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Not very often, I believe we should be able to work well just communicating through Slack and seeing each other during class time
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * It entirely depends on the nature of the decision, fixing a typo is not something that needs to be brought to everybody's attention, but a more complex issue could need every person's input
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Majority rules
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Speak to them openly and honestly about what needs to be done differently. It is fine to have certain people trying to step up, but it cannot be at a detriment to the team's process
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Bring it up to the team, try to offload certain aspects of the process
