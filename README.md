<h1> Team Preferences </h1>
During this year we all expect as a team that we will be able to work together in order to avoid feeling forgotten or overwhelmed with the work placed on us. The first step we will take to avoid feeling overwhelmed will be to distribute tasks based on the skill level of our members. We have created this step of the process to help us quickly progress through the storming phase of team development and work towards being a functional and effective team. We also intend to focus on putting our differences aside and come to terms with the capabilities of our teammates. Although the storming phase of any team can’t be totally avoided we hope that by meeting two times a week we can discover how well we work together, how we can improve, and the general pace of our work. Working together is the backbone of any team and the sooner we can work together the more efficient we will be.
  
Throughout this project, we will put our best foot forward as programmers and create a program that our clients will be impressed by and that we will be proud of. We have every intention of being in near-constant communication with each other to facilitate a group focused on supporting each other and sharing the weight of the work. A team is meant to catch one another when they fall and support one another when we succeed and we intend to do just that. When meeting we intend to be respectful to our customer’s requests and our teammate’s concerns. The marketplace of ideas is extremely important to all of us and we know that staunching the flow of creativity can blind us to simplistic yet elegant solutions. 
When discussions deviate from peaceful and respectful we will meet in person to address the tension and come to a decision on how to move forward from this point. While we will be focusing on the inner workings of our group, our main goal is to deliver a product that satisfies our customer’s needs and that we are pleased with.
